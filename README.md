# 🖐️ Greetings & Hello

## 👋 About Me

- I’m a **Data Scientist** & **Solutions Architect** with **7+ Years of Experience** and strong focus on delivering real-world impact through technology.

- I've always been passionate about computer science and data science, and fascinated by how technology can create new possibilities for businesses and meaningful value for users.

- I help organizations build intelligent systems, data apps, and automated platforms — solutions that are not just technically sound, but purpose-built for scale and clarity.

- My work blends **machine learning, deep learning, llms, data visualization, and cloud-native design** — enabling better decisions and smoother operations.

- I also consult as a **freelancer**, working with teams to design and deploy full-stack, data-driven solutions — from prototype to production.

- Whether it’s dashboards, models, APIs, or vector databases, I focus on solutions that integrate well, perform reliably, and solve actual problems.

> 💡 I believe good tech isn't just novel — it’s valuable, usable, and aligned with people’s needs.
